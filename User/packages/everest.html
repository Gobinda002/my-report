                                    We will start our trip in the early morning. Following our breakfast, our guide
                                    will help you to get to Machha Pokhari Bus station. From there we will head
                                    towards Dhunche(2,030m/6,660ft) from Kathmandu by bus.

                                    On the way, we will be able to enjoy the picturesque settlements and meadows.
                                    Through beautiful scenic route and along with immense Trishuli river, it will
                                    take us around 5-6 hours to reach Dhunche.

                                    Dhunche is a small settlement area and the headquarter of Rasuwa District. After
                                    our arrival in Dhunche, we will stroll around the village and spend our time
                                    with locals. After spending a wonderful evening with locals, we will stay
                                    overnight in a well-maintained tea house.

                                    We will start our day 2 trek after our breakfast in Dhunche and we will ascent
                                    towards Chandanwari. After hiking roughly for 2 hours, we will reach Deurali
                                    (2,500m), a small village on the way to Chandanbari with a few tea houses.

                                    Via a beautiful trail, passing through streamlets and cascades we will reach Dhimsa
                                    (2,900m) after 3 hours of hiking. From Dhimsa, the climb is slightly difficult, as
                                    the trail goes uphill through beautiful pine forests. We have to hike steep uphill
                                    sections to reach Chandanwari(3200m), a settlement located at the lap of a pine
                                    forest. People also call this place Sing Gompa.

                                    Chandanwari has a lot to offer its visitors. A Yak cheese factory and a monastery
                                    are the major attractions of Chandanwari. We will try the delicious Yak cheese and
                                    visit Sing Gompa.

                                    In the evening, after a hearty meal with lots of cheese, we will spend our night in
                                    Chandanwari.

                                    Following our hearty breakfast in Chandanwari, we will hike uphill to
                                    Gosaikunda(4361m). Today the hiking will be comparatively more difficult than
                                    yesterday.

                                    The trail gradually ascends up from the beginning. We will be hiking via rugged and
                                    narrow trail all the way to Gosaikunda. Gradually when we ascend, you will have to
                                    walk through barren hills and encounter cold breeze. So, make sure you have clothes
                                    warm enough to keep you fine in such a cold environment.

                                    After hiking for nearly 1 and a half hour, we will get to Cholangpaty(3500m). Now
                                    the views of mountains like Langtang Lirung(7234m), Langtang Ri(7205m),
                                    Manaslu(8163m) and Ganesh Himal(7422m) are close and clear.

                                    Another 2 hours of the walk will take us to Lauribinayak(3900m). From Lauri Binayak,
                                    a panoramic view of Langtang Lirung, Ganesh Himal, Masalu and Langtang Ri can be
                                    enjoyed.

                                    Then, after hiking up for roughly 2 hours, we will reach a temple called Sakyamuni,
                                    which carries both Hindus and Buddhists values. After hiking for half an hour we
                                    will see the first lake, Saraswati Kunda, then Bhairav Kunda and the Mighty Lake
                                    Gosaikunda. We will visit other nearby lakes and spend the night in a tea house.

                                    Enjoying the beautiful morning, we will have our breakfast in our hotel. We will
                                    explore Gosaikunda then retrace our steps downhill to Dhunche via Lauribinayak,
                                    Dhimsa, and Deurali.

                                    Today is the last trekking day. So, enjoy every bit of the trek. Enjoying the
                                    alluring views of mountains, pine forest and the flavourful cheese of Chandanwari,
                                    we will be hiking downhills. Since we will be descending, hiking will be a bit
                                    easier and fun. We will also spot different protected birds in the trail like Wood
                                    Snipe, Snow Partridge, Tibetan Snow Cock, etcetera.

                                    After hiking roughly for 7 hours we will reach Dhunche.

                                    Trishuli river, meadows and picturesque settlements.

                                    After riding around 6-7 hours we will reach Kathmandu. Our trip ends here.

                                    You will have a lot to cherish from the experience of this trek. The mighty
